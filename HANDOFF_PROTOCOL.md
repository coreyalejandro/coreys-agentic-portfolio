# 🚨 HANDOFF Protocol - Non-Negotiable

## Mandatory Requirement

**Every agent working in this repository MUST update HANDOFF.md after every turn/session.**

This is a **non-negotiable requirement**, not a suggestion or best practice.

## What Must Be Updated

After **every** turn or session, update HANDOFF.md with:

1. **"What Was Just Completed"** - Document all work done
2. **"Current Project State"** - Update if anything changed
3. **"Quick Reference"** - Update date, last commit, status
4. **Any other relevant sections** - Known Issues, Next Steps, etc.

## Scope of Updates

Update HANDOFF.md for **ALL** work, including:
- ✅ Code changes (any file, any size)
- ✅ Configuration changes
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Repository setup changes
- ✅ Bug fixes
- ✅ Feature additions
- ✅ Dependency updates
- ✅ Any work that modifies project state

## Who Must Follow This

**This protocol applies to ALL agents, regardless of:**
- Agent type (CLI, terminal, IDE, API-based, web-based)
- Work method (direct edits, scripts, automation, manual)
- Change scope (major features or minor fixes)
- Access method (local, remote, automated)

## Enforcement

- This is a **mandatory protocol**, not optional
- No exceptions for "small changes" or "quick fixes"
- HANDOFF.md is the single source of truth for project continuity
- Failure to update HANDOFF.md breaks project continuity

## Why This Matters

HANDOFF.md ensures:
- Continuity across different agents and sessions
- Clear project state for any agent picking up work
- Documentation of all changes and decisions
- Prevention of lost context or duplicate work

**Remember: If you worked on this project, update HANDOFF.md. No exceptions.**
