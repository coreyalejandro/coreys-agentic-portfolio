# Section 1: Hero

It’s called a **hero section**, so I want to fully lean into that theme—everything should feel *over-the-top*, cinematic, and heroic.

The experience I want people to have is the same feeling you get watching trailers in a movie theater:
**excitement, anticipation, and emotional build-up**.
I want users to feel that way about *me*.

## Conceptual Reframing

**Change:**

* Neural → **Corey**
* Depth → **Alejandro**
* Magic → **Experience**

## Orbiter Component

Create an **Orbiter Component**: a component that orbits around another component or object.

* There can be:

  * a **text orbiter**
  * an **image orbiter**
  * or orbiters defined purely by motion
* An orbiter should orbit *anything*, regardless of type.

## Title Composition

The word **“The”** should orbit around the header so that the combined effect reads:

> **The Corey Alejandro Experience**

Structure:

* **“The”**

  * Independent / unbound
  * Orbits the header
* **“Corey Alejandro”**

  * Grouped together
  * Retains existing movement
* **“Experience”**

  * Unbound
  * Has its own micro-movement

## Transparent Card (Right Side)

On the right side of the page, there is a **transparent card**.

Conceptually, this card acts like the **movie theater screen during wartime**, when previews flashed bold headlines before the feature presentation.

These headlines represent **my accomplishments**:

* **Creator of PROACTIVE AI**
  A safety-first training and fine-tuning framework: *Intention Is All We Need*
* **Builder of MADMall**
  An agentic, orchestrated luxury virtual mall and wellness & research center catering to Black women with Graves disease
* **Architect and Executive Director of OC Global**
  A mobile-first, R&D-driven accelerated online college
* **Maker of MobileU**
  A machine-learning and SMS-based course development and delivery platform

**Behavior:**

* Headlines loop automatically
* Headlines may include images or be text-only
