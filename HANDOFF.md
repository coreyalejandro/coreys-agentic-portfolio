# 🚀 Agent Handoff: coreys-agentic-portfolio

> **🚨 CRITICAL PROTOCOL: HANDOFF UPDATE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**
>
> **Every agent working in this repository MUST update HANDOFF.md after every turn/session, regardless of:**
>
> - How they access the codebase (CLI, terminal, IDE, API, etc.)
> - What type of work they're doing (code changes, documentation, configuration, etc.)
> - Whether the changes are "major" or "minor"
>
> **This is a mandatory requirement, not a suggestion.** The HANDOFF.md file is the single source of truth for project continuity across all agents and sessions.
>
> **📖 See `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` for complete protocol details.**

**Date:** January 19, 2026
**Status:** Active Development - Motion Smoothing Complete

## 📋 What Was Just Completed

- **Smooth Motion Refactor:**
  - Migrated all manual time-based animations from `setInterval` (10fps) to `requestAnimationFrame` (60fps).
  - Updated `contexts/AnimationContext.tsx` to provide high-fidelity `time` state to all components.
  - Updated `app/components/page.tsx` main state and component preview documentation.
  - Updated functional components including `BreathingBackground.tsx`, `ResumeSection.tsx`, `LaydownCard.tsx`.
  - Updated page templates: `ContactPage`, `LandingTemplate`, `HeroTemplate`, `PortfolioTemplate`.
  - Standardized the use of `requestAnimationFrame` with a `0.016` (1/60s) increment to maintain animation speed while drastically increasing smoothness.
- **Documentation & Memory Update:**
  - Added "Smooth Animations" pattern to `openmemory.md`.
  - Updated OpenMemory facts with implementation details.

## 🎯 Current Project State

### What's Working

- **Navigation:** Floating nav fully functional with:
  - Left side: Documentation, Resume, Superpowers, Projects
  - Right side: Templates, Components, Playground, Design System
  - Hover feedback remains visible and consistent
  - All Tailwind classes use canonical format (no warnings)
- **Theme system:** Theme variables are defined in `app/globals.css` and updated by `contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx` with compat aliases for reliability.
- **Homepage sections:** Superpowers heading renders (no longer transparent).
- **Resume section:** Background matches other sections; printable resume remains readable.
- **Repository:** New remote `coreys-agentic-portfolio` is set up and synced.

### Project Structure

- `app/playground/`: Main logic.

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. Continue with next feature or enhancement
2. All navigation updates are complete and pushed
3. HANDOFF protocol is now established and documented

## 📊 Remaining Enhancements to Implement

- [x] Add Card Path components
- [x] Fix Framer Motion bug
- [x] Enhance 3D effect
- [x] Test "Table Card" perspective
- [x] Test "Scroll Trigger" perspective
- [x] Build Central Playground
- [x] Add Playground to Main Navigation
- [x] Auto-hide Playground Header
- [ ] Integrate Card Path into main portfolio flow

## 📝 Important Context

### 🚨 HANDOFF Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Every agent MUST update HANDOFF.md after every turn/session. This includes:**

- Code changes (any file, any size)
- Configuration changes
- Documentation updates
- Repository setup changes
- Bug fixes
- Feature additions
- Any work that modifies the project state

**Update Requirements:**

1. Update "What Was Just Completed" section with all work done
2. Update "Current Project State" if anything changed
3. Update "Quick Reference" (date, last commit, status)
4. Update any other relevant sections (Known Issues, Next Steps, etc.)
5. Commit the HANDOFF.md update along with your changes

**This protocol applies regardless of:**

- Agent type (CLI, terminal, IDE, API-based)
- Work method (direct edits, scripts, automation)
- Change scope (major or minor)

**No exceptions. This is non-negotiable.**

### User Profile

- Neurotype: Autistic, bipolar, OCD
- Preferences: Single short questions, complete code blocks, step-by-step instructions, no clutter.

### Design Principles

- Prioritize clarity and reduced cognitive load (avoid clutter, keep screens simple).
- Prefer polished, modern UI with accessible interactions (keyboard + focus states).

### Testing Standards

- Manual smoke test key routes after changes (`/`, `/playground`, `/contact`).
- Run `pnpm lint` before shipping (when possible).

### Git Workflow

- Branch: main
- Remote: `git@github.com:coreyalejandro/coreys-agentic-portfolio.git` (remote name: `coreys-agentic-portfolio`)
- Repository: `coreyalejandro/coreys-agentic-portfolio`

## 🔧 Available Commands

- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm start`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm handoff:check`

**Status:** Active Development
**Recommendation:** Perform a smoke test of all animated sections to verify smoothness.
**Confidence:** High - requestAnimationFrame pattern applied globally to all active animation controllers.
